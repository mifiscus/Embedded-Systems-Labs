## Lab 2

### Task 1

Program that uses timers to cycle through on-board LEDs in a waterfall fashion.

### Task 2

A traffic light controller that alternates between red and green lights (states), which includes a start/stop button for user control, and a pedestrian button, that alters the pattern to go from green to yellow then to red. This program uses timer interrupts to control the circuit.

Visual temperature gauge that uses the on-board sensor to display a cascading LED pattern, depending on the temperature recorded.

### Task 2_a

The same visual temperature gauge, but also outputs data to a PuTTY terminal through UART serial communication.

### Task 2_b

A simple program to communicate with a PuTTY terminal over bluetooth, returning any characters the user has typed back to the terminal.
